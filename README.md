PolyFEM is a polyvalent C++ FEM library.

Compilation
-----------

All the C++ dependencies required to build the code are included. It should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it should build out-of-the-box with CMake:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j4

On Linux, `zenity` is required for the file dialog window to work. On macOS and Windows, the native windows are used directly.


### Optional
The formula for higher-order bases is optionally computed at CMake time using an external python script. Consequently, PolyFEM might require a working installation of Python and some additional packages to build correctly:

- `numpy` and `sympy` (optional)
- `quadpy` (optional)

### Docker
Usage:
Build the Docker Image:

```bash
docker build -t polyfem .
```

Run PolyFEM: To run PolyFEM and mount your current directory to /data in the container for input/output:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/data polyfem [PolyFEM arguments]
```
Replace [PolyFEM arguments] with the appropriate arguments to run your simulations (e.g., input/output file paths).

Usage
-----

The main executable, `./PolyFEM_bin`, can be called with a GUI or through a command-line interface. Simply run:

    ./PolyFEM_bin
